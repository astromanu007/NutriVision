### Features
- Recognizes food items from images
- Estimates calorie content of recognized food items
- User-friendly interface for dietary tracking
- Scalable and easily integrable with other applications

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/astromanu007/PRODIGY_ML_05.git
    cd PRODIGY_ML_05
    ```

2. Install required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Dataset
1. Download the dataset (e.g., Food-101 dataset).
2. Unzip the dataset into the `data/` directory:
    ```
    data/
    └── food-101/
        ├── images/
        └── meta/
    ```

### Training the Model
1. Preprocess the data:
    ```sh
    python preprocess_data.py
    ```

2. Train the model:
    ```sh
    python train_model.py
    ```

3. The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory:
    ```
    models/
    └── food_model.h5
    ```

### Using the Model
1. Run the script to recognize food items and estimate calories from an image:
    ```sh
    python recognize_food.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
    ```

2. The output will display the recognized food items and their estimated calorie content.

### Contributing
